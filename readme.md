## Node Typescript Skeleton

- use `yarn start` for hot reloading and constant executing on file changes
- use `yarn run debug` to launch the project in inspect mode. Attach from VS Code with the Attach command.
- run tests with `yarn run test` or with `yarn run test-watch`. Pass in individual file pathes with `yarn run test -- ./path-to/file.test.ts`
- run `yarn run execute` to build js files and execute with Node.
